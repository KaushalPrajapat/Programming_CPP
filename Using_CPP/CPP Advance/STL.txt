//STL is Standard template Library
//Powerful set of C++ template classes

//STL has three well structured components

//1.Container -- Collection of obj. of certain kind
//Vector -- Generate dynamic array
//2.Algorithm -- Perform some action like sorting searching etc
//functions -- sort(),reverse() etc
//3.Iterators -- used to point the container
//it's bridge between container and alogo

//Containers contain data algo. perform action on that data
//Iterators used to access the data or point to container


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    list <float> l1;
    vector <int, char>

}



vector : replicates arrays
queue : replicates queues
stack : replicates stack
priority_queue : replicates heaps
list : replicates linked list
set : replicates trees
map : associative arrays

Classification of Containers in STL
Containers are classified into four categories :

Sequence containers : Used to implement data structures that are sequential in nature like arrays(array) and linked list(list).
Associative containers : Used to implement sorted data structures such as map, set etc.
Unordered associative containers : Used to implement unsorted data structures.
Containers adaptors : Used to provide different interface to the sequence containers.
